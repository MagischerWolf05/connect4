# Connect Four Template

A start of a project implementing a variant of the game "Connect Four".

## Mission

1. Extend the existing code such that the GreedyPlayer works.
2. Implement a strong Opponent using MinMax/Negamax with fixed depth (like 10).
3. Implement a perfect Player and optimize it for speed.

# Connect4 Alpha-Beta Algorithm

## Progress Evaluation
- Successfully implemented the Alpha-Beta algorithm to evaluate game states
- Implemented user input to select the depth of the search

## Areas for Improvement
- Implement different heuristics to improve the accuracy of the algorithm
- Implement a transposition table to optimize the search
- Compare the performance of the optimized algorithm to other state-of-the-art AI algorithms such as Monte Carlo Tree Search
- Invest more time to improve the overall performance of the algorithm and make it more efficient.

## Overall Progress
I would rate my overall progress on the project as a 4 out of 6. The basic implementation of the Alpha-Beta algorithm is functional , but there is still room for improvement in terms of optimization and performance.
